Deck(Script attached to the Deck Objects in game it holds a colection of cards for the players to draw)

- (Deck)public void OnPointerClick 
    - oboslete method created to allow on click deck draws removed functionality because it proved problematic left in potentialy for later use

-  public GameObject findHand
    helper function used with the OnPointerClick function no longer used left if like the OnPointerClick potentialy for later use 

- public void DeckIsEmpty()
    not yet implemented will triger when deck.cards.count = 0 and will take the discard "deck" as an argument and rebuild the deck

- public void shuffle()
    basic sudo random card shuffle re-orders the complete deck

Dropzone(More abstract script curently underdevloped needs retweeking for practical aplication)
 
implemnted but Bairly needs a full re-tool

Hand(specalized dropzone attached to both players and the game board)

- public void AssignPlayer()
    Simple helper function that will assing a player ID to a hand esentialy binding the two 

- public void dealHand()*
    dealHand takes in a deck as an argument and then deals the Set hand "Size" which is a preset int to the the hand that calls the method
    deal hand then instantiates GameObject prefabs and removes them from the master deck moving them to the hand that calld the method

- public void Draw()*
    same as deal hand but only deals one card

    * could be one function that takes an int but for now this works fine also this requires fewer Magic numbers in the controler and is easy 
    to change for testing
